Examples
========

We have several examples to illustrate various features of the code. These
notebooks have been rendered here for the web, but the originals are
found in the ``examples/`` directory of the package, and you can run them
yourself! 

You can also try them out online directly from your browser: |binder|_
(Note: the performance of the online servers can vary widely.)
